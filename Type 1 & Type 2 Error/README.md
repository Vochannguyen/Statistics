Null Hypoothesis: mean 1 equal to mean 2
Alternative Hypothesis: mean 1 not equal to mean 2

## Type 1 Error
Type 1 Error would be rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true
Null Hypoothesis: mean 1 equal to mean 2
Alternative Hypothesis: mean 1 not equal to mean 2

Rejected that the mean 1 is equal to mean 2, but when it is actually true, they are equal.

Another way to explain this Type I error is by concluding that the difference between 
the two groups is not equal to 0 when it really is.

## Type 2 Error
In this case, a Type II error would be failing to reject the null hypothesis when it’s 
actually false, which means concluding that mean creativity scores for the intrinsic and 
extrinsic groups are equal when the true means are actually different.
Another way to explain this Type II error is by concluding that the difference between 
the two groups is equal to 0 when it really isn’t
