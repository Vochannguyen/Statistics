The data suggest each 1 kV increase in voltage is associated with a decrease in the time to insulation breakdown by a factor of 
e-0.507  = 0.6.  

In other words, a one unit increase in Voltage is associated with a 40% decrease in time to breakdown.   

A 95% confidence interval for 𝛽_1  is (-.507 – 1.99*.0574, -.507 + 1.99 * .0574) = (-.621, -.393).    
Therefore a 95% confidence interval for the decrease in breakdown time is   (-47%, -33%)

Voltage explains about 51% of the variation in breakdown time of this insulation fluid.
