### SAS Code
## Step 1) Address Assumptions
- Look at boxplot and distributions of histograms to check normality
- Check Equal Variances





### R Code
fit = lm(Score~Handicap, data = handicap)

library(lsmeans)

leastsquare=lsmeans(fit,"Handicap")

#The columns names must match order of levels of the treatment variable
Contrasts = list(AW=c(.5,-.5,.5,0,-.5))

contrast(leastsquare,Contrasts)
