### Assumptions
The data are ordinal as they are percentages of seedlings. 
We will assume the observations are independent, although significant spatial correlation may be present. 
You may also have assumed that the distributions were the same, except for location.


### SAS
*To compute rank sum test;
proc npar1way data = loggingdata wilcoxon;
class Action;
var PercentLost;
exact HL Wilcoxon;
run;

proc npar1way data = loggingdata wilcoxon alpha = 0.1;
class Action;
var PercentLost;
exact HL Wilcoxon;
run;


### R Code
wilcox.test(PercentLost~Action,data=logging,conf.int=T,alternative="greater")

wilcox.test(PercentLost~Action,data=logging,conf.int=T,alternative="greater",exact=FALSE)

wilcox.test(PercentLost~Action,data=logging,conf.int=T,alternative="greater",exact=FALSE,conf.level=.90)
