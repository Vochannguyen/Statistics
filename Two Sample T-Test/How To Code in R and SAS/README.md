## Conclusion Scripts:

#### Fail to Reject
Based on this test, there is not enough evidence to suggest that the mean amount of pocket cash of the SMU students is different than that of the students from Seattle U (p=0.1732 from a two-sided t-test). A 95% confidence interval for this difference is [-$53, $282]. Since the subjects in this sample were not randomly sampled, the results only generalize to the subjects in the study (no need to discuss causal conclusions for a non-significant result).

**Comment on Interval**: Since 0 is not in the confidence interval, our test strongly reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference is 0. Thus, this is not plausible of the difference of the mean sleeping rating between placebo and vaccine groups. 

#### Reject the Null Hypothesis

**Assumptions are met because of sample sample size:**
There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the mean appetite score of the Vaccine Group is greater than that of the Placebo group and, since this was a randomized experiment, the Vaccine caused this difference (pvalue < .00001 from a pooled two sample t-test). We are 95% confident that Vaccine group has a mean that is between 1.03 and 1.45 points more than the mean appetite score from the Placebo group.  

## Confidence Intervals:
**Example 1:** A 95% confidence interval for this difference is [-1.60,5.44] years (or the 1-sided interval reported above). With 95% confidence, we expect the true mean difference in ages to fall in this interval. In particular, approximately 95% of all confidence intervals created this way should include the true difference in means. Because 0 is included in the interval and is thus a probable value, we donâ€™t have enough evidence to conclude a difference exists.

**Example 2: ** We are 99% confidence that the placebo group has a mean sleep rating that is between .072 and .544 points greater than that of the vaccine group; our best estimate is .308. This one will always agree with .01 test.


### Sample 1
**Problem:** Does placing rats on calcium-deficient diet cause an increase in the consumption of lead-acetate solution? **Remember to use the rats not the people**

**Inferential Limitations:**
This is randomized experiment, so casual inference can be drawn as a result of this analysis.
